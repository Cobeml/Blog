- **Instance theory**: A perspective that assumes memory is a single system that records specific events, and general knowledge emerges from episodic memory during retrieval. It challenges the dominant view of multiple memory systems. Can explain the following in a unified model:
- **Memory and categorization**: Instance theory explains how people can categorize items based on their similarity to stored instances, without abstracting prototypes or rules. It also accounts for false memory effects and amnesia cases.
- **Language**: Instance theory shows how word meanings, speech normalization, and implicit grammar learning can be derived from memory retrieval, without requiring separate semantic or rule-based systems.
- **Associative learning**: Instance theory simulates various phenomena in classical and operant conditioning, such as blocking, overshadowing, and retrospective revaluation, by using memory retrieval and context cues.
