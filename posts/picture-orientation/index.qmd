Scapinello, K. F., & Yarmey, A. D. (1970). The role of familiarity and orientation in immediate and delayed recognition of pictorial stimuli. Psychonomic Science, 21(6), 329–330.
- The authors used three types of stimuli: human faces, canine faces, and buildings. They manipulated the familiarity (presented once or seven times) and the orientation (upright or rotated) of the stimuli in a part-to-whole transfer paradigm.
- Findings:
    * Familiar stimuli were better recognized than unfamiliar stimuli, regardless of orientation and recall interval.
    * Recognition performance declined with stimulus rotation especially for human faces.
    * The decline for human faces was independent of familiarity, suggesting a face-specific factor that makes them more sensitive to rotation.
    * The authors speculated that the face-specific factor might be related to how the face cues are more relliant on orientation.
