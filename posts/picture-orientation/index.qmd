- The authors used three types of stimuli: human faces, canine faces, and buildings. They manipulated the familiarity (presented once or seven times) and the orientation (upright or rotated) of the stimuli in a part-to-whole transfer paradigm.
- The main findings were:
    * Familiar stimuli were better recognized than unfamiliar stimuli, regardless of orientation and recall interval.
    * Recognition performance declined with stimulus rotation and a 20-min delay, especially for human faces.
    * The decline for human faces was independent of familiarity, suggesting a face-specific factor that makes them more sensitive to rotation.
    * The authors speculated that the face-specific factor might be related to the distribution of structural cues in human faces, which undergo greater distortion with rotation than other stimuli.
